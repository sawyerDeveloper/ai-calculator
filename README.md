# AI Calculator ðŸ‘‹

This app has AI inside of it instead of using traditional math/logic.

I created a data structure/algorithm based on the concept of a MODEM(Modulate/Demodulate).

The complex data stream is stored and processed and then broken down into a simpler datatype after muxing like the foundational technology in LLM's and compilers.

It is also fun to make a calculator and covers a bunch of use cases around Array methods.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
3. Choose the platform
